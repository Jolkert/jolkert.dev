			Hi, I'm Morgan! If you've found this site,
			you might know me better (if at all) as <em><abbr title="IPA: /'jɔl.kɚt/">Jolkert</abbr></em>.
			I am a computer science student, amatuer software developer, and hobbyist linguist.
			I have many projects on <a href="https://github.com/jolkert">my GitHub</a>.
			Some of which I'm proud of, some of which should never again see the light of day.

		<h1>Things I've Worked On</h1>
		<!-- TODO: add images -->
		<h2 class ="heart-before"><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemore">Cobblemore</a><span class="path"> modrinth/mod/cobblemore</h2>
		<p>
			<u>Cobblemore</u> is an addon mod for <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon">Cobblemon</a> which adds several held items
			and other useful additions which have not yet been officially implemented.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heart-before"><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/stay-a-while">Stay A While</a><span class="path"> modrinth/mod/stay-a-while</h2>
		<p>
			<u>Stay A While</u> is a Minecraft mod which a few useful gamerules. Three are for controlling when certain types of items despawn.
			The other one controls the chance of a villager becoming a zombie villager when killed by a zombie.
			More gamerules are planned, which will likely bring a new name to the modrinth
		</p>

		<h2 class="heart-before"><a href="https://github.com/Jolkert/Appalachia">Appalachia</a><span class="path"> github/jolkert/Appalachia</span></h2>
		<p>
			<u>Appalachia</u> is a (currently Work-in-Progress) discord bot made for fun.
			It can do simple things such as generating random numbers and pulling random quotes from a designated quotes channel.
			It also features a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Simply mention the user to play against, and make your selection.
			Scores are also stored on a server-wide leaderboard. I'm currently looking into
			<a href="https://github.com/jolkert/appalachia-rs">rewriting him in rust!</a>
		</p>

		<h2 class="heart-before"><a href="https://github.com/Jolkert/DiscordFabricLink">Discord Fabric Link</a><span class="path"> github/jolkert/DiscordFabricLink</span></h2>
		<p>
			<u>Discord Fabric Link</u> is a Minecraft mod that runs a Discord bot.
			It allows users to add themselves to a whitelist using a Discord command, and link their Minecraft account to their Discord user.
			It shows the username color from Discord in Minecraft chat, and shows the Discord username and any pronoun roles on hover.
			(It also includes a few server-side mechanics changes that are extraneous and should probably be part of a different mod).

		<p>
			That's this website! As a developer, I am naturally too proud and stubborn to have a site not made by myself.
			It's nothing fancy. Just plain HTML and CSS (and a little bit of JavaScript for an easter egg or two).

		<p>
			Looking for something else of mine? My GitHub page has most projects I've worked on.
			Some projects on there are old abandoned projects that served as a learning experience.
			Most are abandoned, some
