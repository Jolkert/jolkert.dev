		<h2 class="heart-before section"><u>Who are you?</u></h2>
		<p>
			I'm not really sure how you got here if you don't already know, but just in case:
			my real name is Morgan<span class="pronouns">she/her</span>, but online I go by "Jolkert".
			As your local trans woman programmer, I do a lot of coding and a little bit of a bunch of other stuff
			(mainly lingusitcs related).
			I have quite a few Minecraft mods and a bunch of personal projects that mostly served as learning
			experiences. I am also an aspiring gamedev with a bunch of ideas that never (publically) made it to my
			GitHub. Maybe I'll finish something someday.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heart-before section"><u>"Jolkert"?</u></h2>
		<p>
			Yeah quite a few people struggle with how they're supposed to pronounce this one.
			If you're familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">IPA</a>,
			it's pronounced <span class="ipa">/'jɔl.kɚt/</span> If you're not, the important parts are that the 'J'
			sounds like English 'Y',
			and the 'L' <em>is</em> pronounced.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heart-before section"><u>Languages</u></h2>
		<p>As someone who is interested in both computer science and lingustics, this is a fun one for me because theres
			two answers here</p>
		<p>In terms of programming languages, I am well-versed in:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>C#</li>
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>Kotlin</li>
			<li>Lua</li>
		</ul>
		<p>And I am proficient with, but still in the process of learning:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Rust</li>
			<li>JavaScript</li>
			<li>TypeScript</li>
			<li>C++</li>
			<li>C</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In terms of spoken languages, I speak English natively, and can speak passable German.</p>

		<h2 class="heart-before section"><u>Pretty colors!</u></h2>
		<p>
			If you like the site's color scheme, I recommend you check out <a
				href="https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin">Catppuccin</a>! All of the colors on the site come from
			the catppuccin palette. I use it for everything I can.
